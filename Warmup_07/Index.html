  <h2> The Importance of Family</h2>
  <h3>June 07, 2023

  <div class="text">
    <p>Family is so important. They are the ones who make you the person you become.
       Sure there are ups and downs but they are the ones who build your character.
       You are able to confide with them, put your trust in them, and be vulnerable
       with them. It’s not every day that you find people who will actively and
       caringly listen to what you have to say. Sometimes there are struggles
        where you feel as if you don’t understand each other or have a means of
         communication. But on those days is when you realize that it’s part of
         having a family. You can’t have everything perfect in life, and struggles
          like this helps you grow. In my personal experience, I’ve always had a
          hard time communicating with my family due to a verbal processing
          disorder and an ongoing TBI that has affected my memory. But over the
           years, my family has worked extra hard to understand my case. Sometimes
            through playing music, create art, going on walks, and using our
            bodies to express how we feel. It helps a lot to have people around
            you that want to try and help you, understand you, and make you feel
             important. Especially if they are similar to you, it’s relieving to
              not have to try so hard or to mask your every move. On special days,
               for example, a birthday, the family will always try to make you
               feel important, whether it be an action or putting you on a pedestal
               all throughout the day. It’s the actions that matter and the true
               caringness. And you see this caring action to be true because you
                know them. You know who they are which means you also don’t have
                 to stress. In many cases with friends, relationships can fall
                 apart. But family always prevails, no matter what happens.
                 You stick together because no one will understand you better
                 than your own blood.</p>
