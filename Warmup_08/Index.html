        <p> My design will be about sustainability. I will include links to<br>
          some startups that revolve around environmental sustainability. <br>
          With this assignment, I hope to learn how to create functional websites<br>
          so that I can do my part with environmental, sustainable programs. In my <br>
          design, I will include a site logo with a size element of 200px. Padding element <br>
          of 20-50px for page contect. Margin element 10-30px between site logo and the image <br>
          content. A display element of block for the page contect. A pseudo class hover effect <br>
          for the links. And a fixed position for a majority of the elements on the page. </p>
